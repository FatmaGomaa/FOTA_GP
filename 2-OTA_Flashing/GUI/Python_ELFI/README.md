When you build cross-platform apps with iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.The Realtime Database is really just one big JSON object that the developers can manage in realtime.<p align="center">  <img src="media/1_kiliGRYQIVzsCTx_JsUYdg.png"></p>### Key capabilities* **Realtime**  :   Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Realtime Database uses data synchronization—every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds.   Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about networking code.* **Offline**  :   Firebase apps remain responsive even when offline because the Firebase Realtime Database SDK persists your data to disk.   Once connectivity is reestablished, the client device receives any changes it missed, synchronizing it with the current server state.* **Accessible from Client Devices**  :   The Firebase Realtime Database can be accessed directly from a mobile device or web browser; there’s no need for an application server.   Security and data validation are available through the Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules, expression-based rules that are executed when data is read or written. ### Create your Firebase Database1.

Download and check the responses uploaded to the firebase via the Gateway. ### Connect python script to Firebase Database```py   config = {  "apiKey": "AIzaSyCLVYhUGxHVeIfLW8DkWPZy7kBu4f1-79o",  "authDomain": "fota-905e1.firebaseapp.com",  "databaseURL": "https://fota-905e1.firebaseio.com",  "projectId": "fota-905e1",  "storageBucket": "fota-905e1.appspot.com",  "messagingSenderId": "746270454506",  "appId": "1:746270454506:web:32183900e0176d27b31d93",  "measurementId": "G-ZE9JE4FGRP"    }#FireBase Initialization     firebase = pyrebase.initialize_app(config)db = firebase.database()```### Operations done on firebase* Set value for a certain chiled, or to create the child  ```pydb.child("NodeMCUSemaphore").set(False)```* Get value of a particuler child```pyresult = db.child("NodeMCUs").get()if (result.val() ==  "No_Target_Connected"):```## Qt Designer and GUI### Description:**First we will start by how we can install Pyside2 to make our GUI:**Pyside2 is newer than PyQt and supports Python **v3.8.1** so:1.  First make sure that the version of python you have is 3.8.1 by open CMD and    write :**\>\>python –version**1.  After checking the python version start download Pyside2 using CMD window    and run this command:-   **\>\>pip install PySide2**-   This command will install PySide2 site-packages in the following path-   **C:\\Program Files\\Python38\\Lib\\site-packages\\PySide2\\**-   Also will install the PySide2 GUI converter in the following Path-   **C:\\Program Files\\Python38\\Scripts\\PySide2-uic.exe**-   Then in the PySide site-package folder you will find designer tool called-   **designer.exe**-   Then create shortcut from **designer.exe** of designer app by making **right    click** the choose **send to -\>desktop****Now we have PySide2 designer ……………………………………………………………………………………........****Second we will show how we can make our GUI step by step :**1.  First open Pyside2 just click on **designer.exe,** this page will open![](media/af7236bb6ee803b4ffe23b4d21e201a7.png)2.  Then choose Widget and press create button and this form will open![](media/e94639d2c9e8b09b4c34ad3aa9962963.png)3.  Now we can make your design of GUI by choosing the components from This list![](media/57e240cd30a529508889e54695f84cb6.png)**Now we will see an example to make for example Hardware Family box in ourGUI**-   First we will choose Combo Box from Component list![](media/0b6335744af827b4ba9863c96723704f.png)-   Then we will add it in our form as below![](media/14ea3fbb80dd94123605bf57145657ae.png)-   Then we need to add different types of ECU![](media/bd2bd9df81f6d5dac92e4efb1753a393.png)-   Then if you need for example to change many options related to Combo Box1.  **For example name of Qwidget from object Inspector part**2.  **Changing Qwidget options from property part**3.  **By adding signal to connect ComboBox with any another component using    signal/slot editor**![](media/e140c933d9be01eeeefb3660aee56767.png)-   Then to show result in GUI mode use **ctrl+R**![](media/bf9edabba57c00b0f736c28b30286be3.png)**So in our GUI we used many components as:**-   **Combo Box**-   **Label**-   **Line Edit**-   **Push Button**-   **Text Browser**1.  Then after finishing your GUI design save it in any location you need Then    go to this location and open CMD and write**\>\>pyside2-uic File.ui –o File.py**>   This command used to generate output Python file from File.ui generated from>   PySide2 designer1.  Then open File.py and Write Your Logic that you needed to serve your    application## Threading in Python### What Is a Thread?A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to.### Starting a ThreadTo start a separate thread, you create a Thread instance and then tell it to .start():```py##FetchNodeMCUs Thread Class  class Import_NodeMCUs(QtCore.QThread):  ##The initialization function   def __init__(self):      QtCore.QThread.__init__(self)	      ##The runnable of FetchNodeMCUs py file   def run(self): 	call(["python", "FetchNodeMCUs.py"])        ##pending the Thread for 2Sec      time.sleep(2)    ``````py##starting the FetchNodeMCUs Threadself.fileNodeMCU=Import_NodeMCUs()self.fileNodeMCU.start()```## Steps to operate our GUI and how it workes![](media/ELFI_v2.JPG)-   The user interface to our project just open **Elfi.exe** and it will    direct you to the GUI.	-   The GUI runs three different threads in the back ground.1.  Progress: which is responsible of updating the progress bar in the GUI with the percentage of how much of the hex file has been flashed.2.  Import: which is responsible of getting elf path from the Text Browser, the timestamp of the choosen elf file then passing them both to the **CommReceive.c** and then running it.             Also it runs **FirebaseTrial.py**.3.  Import_NodeMCUs: which is responsible of running the **FetchNodeMCUs.py**.-   Press the Refresh button to choose one of the hardware targets, those targets are registersd through each user that has a gateway.     The script that does this functionality is **FetchNodeMCUs.py** by getting values of NodeMCUs chiled in firebase and pasteing them in NodeMCUs.txt, leaving them for the GUI to fetch and add them to the drop down list.  	-   Browse the **Elf file as (Main_APP.elf)** to flash it to the target-   Press upload and the following will happen:1. **CommReceive.c** constructs the Marker Frame from the timestamp passed to it, then parsses the elf file and constructs all the Erase, Data, Verify frames. While it costructs those frames it opens **tst.txt** and pastes those frames in order, starting from the Marker frame.2. **FirebaseTrial.py** It updates the Marker on the firebase for the gateway to fetch it and compare it to the last verision that it has.   Then it waits for the choosen target to be connected to the firebase server, if it does not, the Status in the GUI will change to **Target not connected**.   If it is connected but the choosen elf is the same as the one already flashed the gateway will update the Marker on the firebase with "Same_Marker", then **FirebaseTrial.py** will fetch the Marker from the firebase, if it holds "Same_Marker", it will update the **progress.txt** and the GUI will show **Application already exists** Status.   If it is not the same application the gateway won't change the Marker on the firebase, and the check in the **FirebaseTrial.py** will lead to the start of the erasing and flashing sequence.   3. Erase and flash sequence is: the **FirebaseTrial.py** updates Frame in firebase with the Erase frame and waits for response, if the response is ok it sends 200 Data frames at a time and waits again for response if it is ok, it sends a Verify frame, it repeates the sending of Data and Verify Frames untill all Data frames has benn sent.   Also while uploading frames it writes in the **progress.txt** the number of sent data blocks and the total number of blocks that needs to be sent, so the GUI can update its progress bar.      -  After finishing the process, the GUI will notify you that the flashing is done.  <p align="center">  <img src="media/FlowChartGUI.png"></p> ## References* https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-firebase-218a23186cd7* https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/* https://stackshare.io/stackups/firebase-vs-google-cloud-storage* https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/
