**FOTA** update is nothing but a remote software-management technology for embeddedsystems, which facilitates wireless firmware upgrade on a device.

FOTA upgrade involves firmware bug fixes, improving the automotive ECU’s functionality, and replacing older firmware version with an updates version (for either fixing an issue or to add a new software feature).
